## Description

DeepDecode is a deep-learning algorithm written for the primary purpose of decoding sequentially encoded molecular fluorescence data (eg. SeqFISH, SeqFISH+ data). Given several 2D images that represent dispirate "barcoding rounds," this algorithm can essentially detect signal and determine parity all in one step. This takes much of the guesswork out of signal detection and decoding of SeqFISH datasets.

### Clustering and Gene Enrichment Analysis
The following are the results of UMAP generation and clustering applied to the aforementioned dataset, which produced the image you see above:
