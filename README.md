## Description

DeepDecode is a deep-learning algorithm written for the primary purpose of decoding sequentially encoded molecular fluorescence data (eg. SeqFISH, SeqFISH+ data). Given several 2D images that represent dispirate "barcoding rounds," this algorithm can essentially detect signal and determine parity all in one step. This takes much of the guesswork out of signal detection and decoding of SeqFISH datasets.
