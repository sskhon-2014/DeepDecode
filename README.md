## Description

This is a pure C++ instantiation of a decoder written for the primary purpose of decoding sequentially encoded molecular fluorescence data (eg. SeqFISH, SeqFISH+ data). This algorithm can, of course, be applied to diverse datasets such as astronomical observations. This is essentially a software that takes many observations/objects whose positions are encoded by three variables (position along the horizontal axis, position along the vertical axis, and signal intensity) and clusters like objects. The primary purpose of this algorithm is to provide rapid, high-fidelity clustering of signal in 2D space ("decoding" of molecular idenities in SeqFISH data). The runtime of FastDecode in the analysis of observations in 2048x2048 space from sparse and high-density SeqFISH data revals the runtime to be a few seconds to half-a-minute, rarely exceeding the 30 second mark.


## Test Run FastDecode

First, compile the C++ code:
```
g++ -o FastDecode *.cpp -std=c++11
```
Then, run FastDecode:
```
./FastDecode input.csv output.csv 45 81 4 2048 1
```
Result of clustering/decoding will appear as output.csv. See author for questions about customizing FastDecode to your desired application.
